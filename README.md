## Stretch Goals:

-Add a "duo" session  
-Create a Bad Interview game mode.

## A little Extra:

My initial vision for this app was to make a party game intended for groups of players using video chat services. I decided to keep it simple initially, and make the game mode a goal for the future. The route I decided to take was to make a tool to help practice for job interviewing. I will use this app to upload questions I am asked during my job search so that I can practice the tough ones. The goal of this app is to help improve the ability to think and construct well thought out reponses while in the spotlight of an interviewer. Hopefully users of this app will have less "umm's, uhh's, and hmmm's" in their future interviews!
